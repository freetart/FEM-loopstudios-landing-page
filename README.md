# FEM-loopstudios-landing-page

landing page challenge for frontend mentor

#### Challenges faced

this is my first react project so i faced a lot of challenges of trying to work with state & figuring out how to make components communicate with each other as well as structuring the overall folder/file system of the project. I will come back to this once I learn more react theory.

#### Solutions

- learn context api for state management
- work with more dynamic data even if it's just local json files

#### Features

- responsive design (the browser needs to be refreshed on some components in order for the responsive changes to kick in)
- animated content

#### Technologies used

- ReactDOM
- SCSS

#### Dependencies

- React Icons
- aos.js
